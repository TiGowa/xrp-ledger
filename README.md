# Should you be worried #

To have been indirectly involved in illegal activities on the XRP Ledger? 

Probably not. 

But the question is legitimate. Everyone, as an individual or entity (company), operating on the XRP Ledger, is entitled to ask the question. Regulators often highlight the fact that decentralised exchanges (DEX) are by nature more subject to criminal activities. Yes, indeed. You don't need to be "KYCised" to create an account and transact value within a DEX. 

In some cases and taking the example of the XRP Ledger, you can even participate in a fraudulent payment without even noticing it. How? At the exception of direct XRP payments, any payment that involves a IOU (I Owe You, basically a debt instrument) can take multiple paths before reaching its beneficiary, using other existing offers to deliver the best option/ path. 

This program that will tell you if you have been, through this type of payments, involved with a crook! Obviously, the progam will tell you if you have been also directly dealing with a scammer. Or if you are identified as one!

Support welcome
