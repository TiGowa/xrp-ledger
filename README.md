Should you be worried...

...to have been indirectly involved in illegal activities on the XRP Ledger? 

Maybe not.

But the question is legitimate. Everyone, as an individual or entity (company), operating on the XRP Ledger, is entitled to ask the question. Regulators often highlight the fact that decentralised exchanges (DEX) are by nature more subject to criminal activities. Yes, indeed. You don't need to be "KYCised" to create an account and transact value within a DEX. 

In some cases and taking the example of the XRP Ledger, you can even participate in a fraudulent payment without even noticing it. How? At the exception of direct XRP payments, any payment that involves a IOU (I Owe You, basically a debt instrument) can take multiple paths before reaching its beneficiary, using other existing offers to deliver the best option/ path. 

I have created a little python program that will tell you if you have been, through one of this type of payments, involved with a crook! Obviously, the progam will tell you if you have been also directly (without the payment path feature of the XRP Ledger) dealing with a scammer. Or even more...if you are identified as one!

Eventually, that opens fascinating questions. When a wallet is identified as fraudulent, could an individual block / blacklist the address? Could the network detect and block automatically the address? As the relationship between an individual and the possible number of wallets is 1 to n, would the action of blocking a wallet, considering its activity, be fruitless?
